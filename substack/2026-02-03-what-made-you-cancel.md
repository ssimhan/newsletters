A customer slides into your shop.

No footsteps, no sound.

You can barely see them. Just a shimmer in the air; a faint outline where a person should be.

Are they even there?

They’re holding something you sold them last week.

They seem… upset? Disappointed? It’s hard to tell. Their face is a blur.

They say nothing. But they want something.

A return.

Okay.

You hold your breath. Close your eyes.

You silently take the item. Hand them the cash.

Not a word exchanged.

They drift towards the door, fading away.

Ghostly quiet.

Gone.

* * *

Bizarre.

Except… this is exactly how most startups handle churn.

A customer clicks “cancel”.

“Are you sure?”. “Confirm”.

_Not a word exchanged. Not even a glance._

_Gone._

If this were in person, you’d talk to them. You’d try to understand.

“What went wrong?”, “Do you want something else?”, “How can we fix it?”.

Why don’t startups do this?

There’s so much you can do with that moment of churn.

It starts with a simple question:

**What** **made you cancel?**

## Listen

About 80% of churn is voluntary.

Customers are making a choice. Choosing to cancel, versus a failed payment or expired card.

You have their attention, even if just for a moment.

In that moment, ask: “What made you cancel?”[1](#footnote-1).

What they tell you is critical. You’ll use that information over and over. So let’s make that information high quality.

Provide buckets:

*   Too expensive[2](#footnote-2)
    
*   Don’t need it anymore
    
*   Expectations not met
    
*   Prefer an alternative
    
*   Technical problems
    
*   Missing functionality
    

Then go beyond the bucket: ask for an explanation. Even better, _require_ an explanation[3](#footnote-3).

Make it mandatory. Impose a minimum character limit.

Sure, haters will hate, complainers will complain.

But you _and your customers_ will be better off with this info.

Of course, you’ll receive some nonsense. Terse, one-word answers. Straight up gibberish.

So: why not have AI scan in realtime? Check if the explanation was specific enough to act on, and if not, prompt for more detail[4](#footnote-4)

This starts with simple logic. For example:

*   The user says: **Don’t need it anymore**
    
*   You suggest: **Pause subscription for one month**
    

But again, why stop at basic, linear rules?

You’re already capturing reasons and detailed explanations. You already know the customer’s plan history, usage, location, and more. The customer is churning — it’s now or never.

Imagine the customer typed: “I’m a student and I don’t need this over summer”.

We know they’re on the student plan. We know they were a happy and engaged user.

A _good_ offer might be a free month, but the _best_ offer might let them pause for _three_ months.

Avoid the hassle of reinventing the wheel. Use off-the-shelf solutions like Churnkey’s [Adaptive Offers](https://churnkey.co/feature/adaptive-offers/?utm_source=gauravvohra&utm_medium=partner&utm_campaign=Jan-2026).

## Synthesize

With maximum churn saved, go back to those reasons.

Now batch it into discrete areas. For example:

> **Engineering**
> 
> *   Technical issues (bugs, failed flows, downtime)
>     
> *   Usability issues (performance, UI/UX)
>     
> 
> **Product**
> 
> *   Use case not solved well enough
>     
> *   Entirely missing use case
>     
> 
> **Growth**
> 
> *   Couldn’t reach value fast enough
>     
> *   Price didn’t match value
>     
> 
> **Marketing**
> 
> *   Promising the wrong thing
>     
> *   Bringing in the wrong customers
>     

Then assemble the information to answer:

*   What was the total amount of churn?
    
*   How much was successfully saved?
    
*   How did it break down by bucket? By ownership area?
    
*   What are the big changes versus last week?

## Act

The hardest part.

Most companies fail to act on churn.

I think the failure is two-part: a lack of information, and a lack of prioritization.

If you’ve followed the above, you should have near-perfect information.

But prioritization is genuinely hard.

So let me suggest a framework.

**First: do you have PMF?**

There are [many definitions for PMF](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/how-to-know-if-youve-got-productmarket).

From “[40%+ of customers say they’d be ‘very disappointed’ if your product disappeared tomorrow](https://review.firstround.com/how-superhuman-built-an-engine-to-find-product-market-fit/)”, to “[customers are buying the product as fast as you can make it](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html)”, to “[customers are spontaneously telling other people about it](https://blog.samaltman.com/before-growth)”.

In the context of churn, [if your retention curve relentlessly slopes towards 0%](https://brianbalfour.com/essays/product-market-fit), you don’t have PMF:

If you see this, your only job is to get to PMF.

To get there faster, pay close attention to what churning customers are saying.

**If you do have PMF, your retention curves will flatten.**

Then you should ask: how hard is it to raise the point where that flattening happens?

If it’s quick and easy, just do it.

Every churn improvement benefits all current _and_ future cohorts.

Meanwhile, leaving issues unfixed means burning through customers you’ll never get a second chance with. This hurts revenue _and_ brand.

So: fix bugs. Adjust pricing. Ship features. All of it, sitting right there in your churn data.

**Now you’re left with the hard stuff.**

You have PMF. You’ve picked the low-hanging fruit.

But your churn data is surfacing gaps. Most likely these are product swings that need real investment.

This is where you shift from _reacting_ to churn to _channeling_ what you’re learning into product strategy.

How to build that strategy is beyond this piece.

But here’s an obvious truth: most companies make these decisions with _far worse_ information than you now have.

You have a stream of customers telling you exactly why they left.

That’s gold. Use it.

* * *

Why doesn’t every company do this?

There’s no technology barrier.

It starts with one question: what made you cancel?

[1](#footnote-anchor-1)

“What made you cancel?” is a better question than “Why did you cancel?”. [Jason Cohen tested both phrasings](https://x.com/lennysan/status/2015842287524446609), and found the former question doubles response quality.

[2](#footnote-anchor-2)

[From the same interview](https://x.com/lennysan/status/2015842287524446609), “too expensive” is never the _full_ explanation. Customers already saw and accepted your pricing, so something else changed. When customers cite price, uncover the real reason, such as unmet expectations, feature gaps, or changed needs.

[3](#footnote-anchor-3)

Be aware that single-click cancellation laws (California, New York, EU, etc) mean you can't _gate_ cancellation on a survey. But you can still ask for feedback as part of the flow.

[4](#footnote-anchor-4)

Product owners agonize over whether to introduce ‘intrusive’ experiences like this. My rule of thumb: if something is ultimately in service of _improving the customer experience_, do it.
