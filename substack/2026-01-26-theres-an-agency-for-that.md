I wouldn’t want to be a marketer right now.

Of course, I _am_ a marketer right now.

I market myself. I market the companies I advise. I help marketers market.

But I specifically wouldn’t want to be _one_ marketer, at _one_ company.

AI is breaking the role.

Why? And what should founders and marketers do about it?

## The case for humans

There’s an explosion in AI tooling for marketers.

Most seek to 10x, 100x, or 1000x existing output. Some want to automate the entire endeavor.

One can’t help but ask: is there still room in marketing for humans?

I believe the answer is and always will be yes.

[Taste matters](https://substack.gauravvohra.com/p/taste-resonance). Slop smells.

World-class marketing requires the unexpected. A flash of insight. A little _je ne sais quoi_.

Humans provide this raw creativity.

## In-house marketers

The logical conclusion for most of the last century was to employ full time marketers.

Marketers take _your_ message to _your_ market. _Your_ product reaching _your_ customers. Beating _your_ competitors in _your_ channels.

This required an enormous amount of context.

The cost of learning all that context justified permanent roles.

Specialties, constantly covered. The social media marketer, the performance marketer, the content marketer[1](#footnote-1).

A _permanent_ team of builders.

Always producing, always on.

## Context shift

AI is increasingly capable of handling vast context.

With near-instant ramp-up time.

And they’re getting faster to adapt, more nuanced, and more self-directed on long-range tasks.

The context that necessitated in-house marketers is rapidly shifting from meatware to software.

This threatens the in-house marketer.

Not directly from software. Marketers won’t directly lose their jobs to AI agents.

The bigger threat is its humble namesake: the _marketing agency_.

AI-powered and fiercer than ever.

## Cambrian-era explosion

Agencies [aren’t new](https://www.avenga.com/magazine/history-advertising-agency/).

They’ve long bridged the gap between annoying work companies would rather skip, and business outcomes.

How are they changing?

A century ago, agencies were expensive to run, expensive to hire.

Affordable to only the biggest companies.

This made sense. Production required actual factories. Distribution required horse-drawn carriage. Media access was scarce and secretive.

The internet compressed this.

A few high-skilled professionals were all it took.

One Ad Managered, another Photoshopped, a third SQLed.

AI is compressing it yet again.

Now all it takes is an individual and an internet connection.

They don’t need to write any copy, push any pixels, crunch any numbers.

Their AI does it all.

Why is this better than an in-house marketer?

They get to try, fail, and learn across _dozens of companies_ at the same time. The in-house marketer doesn’t stand a chance.

Tiny, AI-first agencies are flourishing.

We’re in a Cambrian-era explosion of agency diversity.

Every possible niche in the marketing ecosystem is being filled by solo practitioners and small agencies who do _one thing, extremely well, over and over again._

## There’s an agency for that

I’m seeing it first hand.

For every marketing need at startups I advise, a boutique agency meets the need 10x or 100x better than an in-house marketer.

Want to host B2B sales prospects at fancy dinners?

_There’s an agency for that._

Flood social media with UGC?

_There’s an agency for that._

Hack Reddit threads?

_There’s an agency for that._

From organic and paid search, to LinkedIn ghostwriting, to memes on X, and beyond.

If you can imagine it, there’s an agency for it.

They exist because they supply human taste.

_Intimate_ IRL dinners. _Authentic_ Reddit posts. _Funny_ X memes.

These aren’t automatable, but they sure are delegatable.

## Strictly rational

This part is non-obvious to founders and marketers.

For startups, it is _strictly rational_ to hire the agency.

On the one hand, spend 40 hours over 6 weeks to hire one person.

On the other, spend 4 hours over 1 week to engage the world’s best agency.

The choice is obvious.

By the time you’ve [defined](https://substack.gauravvohra.com/p/stop-hiring-people), opened, and filled the role, the channel’s changed. The [W’s on X](https://x.com/tobinwtang/status/2010537973746483248). The arb’s gone.

Hire a marketer?

You needed them last month.

## Chief Marketing Orchestrator

As a founder or marketing leader, your role has shifted.

From:

*   runner → coach
    
*   executor → coordinator
    
*   marketer → multithreader
    

You distribute context, pull strings, and uphold taste.

You are the [Chief Marketing Orchestrator](https://topline.beehiiv.com/p/the-rise-of-the-multithreaded-marketer).

With a myriad of agencies at your disposal, your success depends on 3 things:

1.  Defining a cohesive strategy
    
2.  Finding the world’s best
    
3.  Driving accountability
    

I cover [defining a cohesive marketing strategy here](https://substack.gauravvohra.com/p/the-unfair-advantages-framework).

So how do you find the world’s best and hold them accountable?

## Finding the world’s best

Consider an analogy: painters, plumbers, electricians.

Knowledge-intense specialists who bring meticulous execution with a dollop of creativity.

How would you hire for excellence in those roles?

You’d ask your friends to get high-signal referrals.

Then you’d ask a few things.

How many times have you done this before? _Answer: hundreds, if not thousands of times_.

What’s your track record? _Answer: endless 5\* reviews._

How soon can you start? _Answer: immediately._

How fast are you? _Answer: unbelievably fast._

How expensive is this? _Answer: surprisingly reasonable_.

Litmus test: don’t trust a marketing agency that sucks at marketing itself.

## Driving accountability

Underrated yet necessary skill: driving accountability.

On average, in-house marketers care more. Their upside _and_ downside are higher_._

This doesn’t mean agencies are worse, but they do need to be managed.

First, _define excellence_.

*   Absorb industry benchmarks
    
*   Observe the best in your industry
    
*   Define your goal, in numbers, feel, or both
    

Write it down. Be precise.

Then, _demand excellence_.

For each effort, require written update weekly; accept nothing less.

Use this template:

> Relative to our goal:
> 
> *   What did we accomplish this week?
>     
> *   What results did we drive?
>     
> *   What did we learn?
>     
> *   What will we do differently next week?
>     

If progress is being made each week, up the stakes.

If stalling out, cut and replace.

It’s that simple.

* * *

Have a marketing problem?

There’s an agency for that.

Choose well. Delegate hard. Replace fast.

I anticipate that the few interesting full-time roles in marketing left behind will be product and brand marketing. Everything else will be better handled through agency and automation.
