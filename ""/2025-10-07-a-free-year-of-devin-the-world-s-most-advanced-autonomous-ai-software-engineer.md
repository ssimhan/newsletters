👋  Hey there, I’m Lenny. Each week, I tackle reader questions about building product, driving growth, and accelerating your career. For more: Lennybot [ https://substack.com/redirect/ff9dbedc-45b0-4ebd-98f4-120e57568706?j=eyJ1IjoiMTdxcWYifQ.MfxQ_MIi__85hddye3ASgY7Mnmj6Wchtq0jhU4BE8CA ] | Lenny’s Podcast [ https://substack.com/redirect/bf921864-4ed4-475d-bd57-6945bf0164e4?j=eyJ1IjoiMTdxcWYifQ.MfxQ_MIi__85hddye3ASgY7Mnmj6Wchtq0jhU4BE8CA ] | How I AI [ https://substack.com/redirect/11c0403a-58d9-4675-bd79-ef4488b799a9?j=eyJ1IjoiMTdxcWYifQ.MfxQ_MIi__85hddye3ASgY7Mnmj6Wchtq0jhU4BE8CA ] | Lenny’s Reads [ https://substack.com/redirect/5762d8e8-c3f4-4a80-9185-6cdc8364f5dd?j=eyJ1IjoiMTdxcWYifQ.MfxQ_MIi__85hddye3ASgY7Mnmj6Wchtq0jhU4BE8CA ] | Courses [ https://substack.com/redirect/3f141796-b57e-4ab0-b148-81b6ce23b5be?j=eyJ1IjoiMTdxcWYifQ.MfxQ_MIi__85hddye3ASgY7Mnmj6Wchtq0jhU4BE8CA ]
The vision for the Lenny’s Newsletter Product Pass [ https://substack.com/redirect/3f8fa7c5-f34c-4429-b10b-b07b2d55e12b?j=eyJ1IjoiMTdxcWYifQ.MfxQ_MIi__85hddye3ASgY7Mnmj6Wchtq0jhU4BE8CA ] is to give you access to the most cutting-edge and important tools and technologies, so that you can experience them—not just read about them. Beginning this week, I’ll be adding a new premium product to the collection each month. Some will be available to all annual subscribers, while others will be exclusive to Insiders [ https://substack.com/redirect/1234392c-ffbd-47fe-92d6-eb2c9f326664?j=eyJ1IjoiMTdxcWYifQ.MfxQ_MIi__85hddye3ASgY7Mnmj6Wchtq0jhU4BE8CA ] (our premium annual tier).
Starting today, Insider subscribers [ https://substack.com/redirect/1234392c-ffbd-47fe-92d6-eb2c9f326664?j=eyJ1IjoiMTdxcWYifQ.MfxQ_MIi__85hddye3ASgY7Mnmj6Wchtq0jhU4BE8CA ] get a free year of Devin [ https://substack.com/redirect/d41fd859-8236-4b47-a571-c0f57f5d2360?j=eyJ1IjoiMTdxcWYifQ.MfxQ_MIi__85hddye3ASgY7Mnmj6Wchtq0jhU4BE8CA ], the world’s most advanced autonomous AI software engineer.
The team behind Devin has never offered a deal like this before. This partnership is a significant investment from them. With this collab and more, I hope to get more people exposed to the future of how products will be built.
This adds an additional $1,350 in value to your Insider subscription [ https://substack.com/redirect/1234392c-ffbd-47fe-92d6-eb2c9f326664?j=eyJ1IjoiMTdxcWYifQ.MfxQ_MIi__85hddye3ASgY7Mnmj6Wchtq0jhU4BE8CA ] (for just $350/year)—on top of the more than 15 premium products you already have a year of free access to (worth over $10,000): Lovable, Replit, Bolt, n8n, Wispr Flow, Descript, Linear, Gamma, Superhuman, Granola, Warp, Perplexity, Raycast, Magic Patterns, Mobbin, and ChatPRD [ https://substack.com/redirect/3f8fa7c5-f34c-4429-b10b-b07b2d55e12b?j=eyJ1IjoiMTdxcWYifQ.MfxQ_MIi__85hddye3ASgY7Mnmj6Wchtq0jhU4BE8CA ]. Not to mention this newsletter and a thriving private Slack community.
And there’s much more in store in the coming months.
What is Devin
Devin is an autonomous AI engineer. You assign it bugs, features, or complex refactors through Slack, Linear, Jira, or its website. It writes the code, then sends you a pull request to review.
Tens of thousands of people are using Devin in production today, including top teams at Ramp, Nubank, Goldman Sachs, Citi, and Microsoft.
Why I love Devin
It’s the most widely deployed enterprise-ready AI engineer on the market, and every forward-thinking builder I know who’s used Devin absolutely loves it:
Claire Vo [ https://substack.com/redirect/4efb2193-af63-4125-b206-40f3b9146572?j=eyJ1IjoiMTdxcWYifQ.MfxQ_MIi__85hddye3ASgY7Mnmj6Wchtq0jhU4BE8CA ] told me that Devin is the #2 contributor to her six-figure ChatPRD [ https://substack.com/redirect/1aa73736-79bb-4e23-89f7-4ee29fac3291?j=eyJ1IjoiMTdxcWYifQ.MfxQ_MIi__85hddye3ASgY7Mnmj6Wchtq0jhU4BE8CA ] business (behind only her, for now) and touches 100% of their PRs, by reviewing code, updating documentation, or writing all of the code. Here’s Claire’s interview with Devin co-creator Scott Wu [ https://substack.com/redirect/f362d27f-9aa2-4b61-9946-0a1faa6f8e11?j=eyJ1IjoiMTdxcWYifQ.MfxQ_MIi__85hddye3ASgY7Mnmj6Wchtq0jhU4BE8CA ].
Sahil Lavingia [ https://substack.com/redirect/0e7b2bee-bbba-4694-8bbe-9e79e19a6718?j=eyJ1IjoiMTdxcWYifQ.MfxQ_MIi__85hddye3ASgY7Mnmj6Wchtq0jhU4BE8CA ] has been proudly sharing that Devin is Gumroad [ https://substack.com/redirect/f4475be6-b982-4bbf-9df1-3b661360143e?j=eyJ1IjoiMTdxcWYifQ.MfxQ_MIi__85hddye3ASgY7Mnmj6Wchtq0jhU4BE8CA ]’s #1 contributor of code, with over 1,500 merged PRs (averaging 10 per day).
Dan Shipper [ https://substack.com/redirect/c4b2c82f-b7af-44ee-a779-19adfcaaba56?j=eyJ1IjoiMTdxcWYifQ.MfxQ_MIi__85hddye3ASgY7Mnmj6Wchtq0jhU4BE8CA ] said, “Working with Devin is familiar because it feels like adding a few junior engineers to your team. You toss them tasks, and they’ll get started with enthusiasm . . . It’s programming leverage—it’s productivity power.” Here’s Dan’s chat with Scott Wu [ https://substack.com/redirect/e6ff70be-33f5-4214-86a7-fa8f642ae74d?j=eyJ1IjoiMTdxcWYifQ.MfxQ_MIi__85hddye3ASgY7Mnmj6Wchtq0jhU4BE8CA ] comparing Devin to Claude Code.
Devin ranks #1 in the Builder Arena [ https://substack.com/redirect/b485dbef-2a1d-49c5-97d0-fc5151ffbd2d?j=eyJ1IjoiMTdxcWYifQ.MfxQ_MIi__85hddye3ASgY7Mnmj6Wchtq0jhU4BE8CA ], ahead of Cursor, Lovable, Replit, and Figma Make—a benchmark based on thousands of people blindly comparing the output of each AI’s product being given the same prompt.
Also, Scott Wu [ https://substack.com/redirect/73af00a4-9528-4968-9609-01dd11523591?j=eyJ1IjoiMTdxcWYifQ.MfxQ_MIi__85hddye3ASgY7Mnmj6Wchtq0jhU4BE8CA ] (CEO of Cognition [ https://substack.com/redirect/e681dc1d-c119-4476-9913-da4a9c24c838?j=eyJ1IjoiMTdxcWYifQ.MfxQ_MIi__85hddye3ASgY7Mnmj6Wchtq0jhU4BE8CA ]) is something else:
How you might use Devin
Most people use Devin to take on their bugs and feature requests, but you can work with Devin to:
Scope new roadmap ideas
Update UI and add visual polish to your site
Handle QA on product changes
Keep internal documentation up to date
Take a first pass at data analysis requests
Take on the most tedious items on your backlog
Build SaaS integrations
Send daily summaries of shipped changes
Tackle complex migrations: Nubank [ https://substack.com/redirect/d7284ced-8cca-49c7-8413-a5549548ceee?j=eyJ1IjoiMTdxcWYifQ.MfxQ_MIi__85hddye3ASgY7Mnmj6Wchtq0jhU4BE8CA ] used Devin to migrate their over-6-million-line ETL monolith over the course of a couple of weeks, which otherwise would have been an 18-month and 1,000-engineer project.
Increase your unit test coverage: Litera [ https://substack.com/redirect/54575f64-75e4-45f8-aeda-f1d8b4050e64?j=eyJ1IjoiMTdxcWYifQ.MfxQ_MIi__85hddye3ASgY7Mnmj6Wchtq0jhU4BE8CA ] used Devin to increase their test coverage by 40%, which reduced their regression cycles from three weeks to two days.
Most people begin with Devin as an AI software engineer, handing off well-scoped software engineering tasks. They then expand into QA, product, analytics, and CX.
The goal is to take on all of the lower-level work so that you have more time to focus on figuring out what to build and how to get it into the hands of users.
Check out their website [ https://substack.com/redirect/d41fd859-8236-4b47-a571-c0f57f5d2360?j=eyJ1IjoiMTdxcWYifQ.MfxQ_MIi__85hddye3ASgY7Mnmj6Wchtq0jhU4BE8CA ] for more.
