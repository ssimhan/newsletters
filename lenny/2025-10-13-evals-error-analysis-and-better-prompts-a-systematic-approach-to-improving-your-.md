Hamel Husain, an AI consultant and educator, shares his systematic approach to improving AI product quality through error analysis, evaluation frameworks, and prompt engineering. In this episode, he demonstrates how product teams can move beyond &#8220;vibe checking&#8221; their AI systems to implement data-driven quality improvement processes that identify and fix the most common errors. Using real examples from client work with Nurture Boss (an AI assistant for property managers), Hamel walks through practical techniques that product managers can implement immediately to dramatically improve their AI products.

What you&#8217;ll learn:

A step-by-step error analysis framework that helps identify and categorize the most common AI failures in your product

How to create custom annotation systems that make reviewing AI conversations faster and more insightful

Why binary evaluations (pass/fail) are more useful than arbitrary quality scores for measuring AI performance

Techniques for validating your LLM judges to ensure they align with human quality expectations

A practical approach to prioritizing fixes based on frequency counting rather than intuition

Why looking at real user conversations (not just ideal test cases) is critical for understanding AI product failures

How to build a comprehensive quality system that spans from manual review to automated evaluation
